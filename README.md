# TheWarriorScheduler
An application to find the best possible schedules for Waterloo students. (WIP)

<br/>

## TODO:
### Add Rating System for generated schedule:
   - Professor Rating (Need a way to get ratings off of RateMyProf)
   - Distance Rating (Based on distance between buildings using API to get lat/longitude and then using Google Maps)
   - ~~Gap Rating (Based on number of small gaps)~~ **âœ“**
   - Lunch Rating (Based on time allocated for lunch)
   - Early Bird/Night Owl (No 8:30 Classes, if possible)
   - Proximity Rating (Least number of changes from current schedule, if given one)
   - Scale Individual Ratings out of 100, scale overall ratings based on importance (Professor Rating > Gap Rating)
   
<br/>

### General Stuff:
   - Include TUT, TST in Schedule
   - Accomodate ENG Classes (One Lecture, Multiple Classes)
   - Show Open Classes Only (Or Blue Square if class if full, eventually take reserves into account)
